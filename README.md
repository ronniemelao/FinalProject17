# FinalProject17
Choose-your-adventure text-based game in which the player is taken along a journey, and they make choices along the way
# Player will be taken through an adventure, and they will be making choices along the way. Different choices result in different
# outcomes for the player, so the player can decide their own fate.

# I would like to use a lot of print functions to display the story, and use a function that displays the text character by character.

# I will use input functions to prompt the player to make a choice, and every choice will have a different outcome, resulting in
# a lot of branches to the story.

# I will try to incorporate classes into my game, but I am unsure where I would use it.
