Choose-your-adventure text-based game in which the player is taken along a journey, and they make choices along the way
# Player will be taken through an adventure, and they will be making choices along the way. Different choices result in different outcomes for the player, so the player can decide their own fate. At the end, there is a trivia section. If the player answers successfully, they will survive and leave the island.

# I would like to use a lot of print functions to display the story, and use a function that displays the text character by character.

# I will use input functions to prompt the player to make a choice, and every choice will have a different outcome, resulting in a lot of branches to the story.
